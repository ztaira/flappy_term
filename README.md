# Flappy Term
Hack-A-Week 4: Ascii Flappy Bird clone inspired by Flappy Bird.

### Features:

### What it does:
- It's an ASCII flappy bird knockoff. It lets you play flappy bird.
- Checks for collisions between the bird/pipes and bird/boundary
- Changes gameplay based on the size of your terminal window
- Uses ncurses library to render text and color

### What it doesn't do:
